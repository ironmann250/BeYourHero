Hyrule castle model ripped from Twilight Princess by LinkEpona06
Textures ripped by alecpike from Mario 64 (the mosaic is the original market texture from Ocarina of Time)
Signs ripped by Peardian.
I did the rest. Crediting me is optional, but it's appreciated. (If you are going to credit me, credit LinkEpona06, Peardian, and alecpike too)
